- I open the file with r2 get_boflag
- digit aaa and afl for see all the functions
- I see that there is a main function and i want to inspect it with pdf @main
- Than I see all the functions call in main and the block of print "nice, you want it!"
- so i look in that block and i see the call of sym.print_flag at 0x004007bc. I remember this address
- go to gdb with gdb get_boflag
- put a breakpoint into main with b main
- than run the program and it stop 
- write jump *0x004007bc      
- that's it here is the flag -> spritz{b0f_ch4ng3S_v4riabl3s_xdxd}
